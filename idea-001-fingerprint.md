# Fingerprint Authentication for Trigger

## Problem

People who do not own the gun, but have access to the gun, end up using it without permission.

## Idea 

When a gun is bought, the gun is programmed to work only for the owner, based on the owner's fingerprint. A fingerprint sensor is common place for even accessing our mobile phones, laptops, etc. Why not use such a biometric authentication in the gun's trigger?


## Solution

* The trigger is attached with a fingerprint scanner that authenticates the owner. 
* If it is the owner pressing the trigger, then the gun works as expected. 
* If anyone other than the owner of the gun presses the trigger, then the trigger does not engage and puts the gun automatically on safety. 
* *Bottom-line:* Unauthenticated pressing of trigger will not work. Only registered owner of a gun can operate the gun.
