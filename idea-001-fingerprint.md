# Fingerprint Authentication for Trigger

## Problem

People who do not own the gun, but have access to the gun, end up using it without permission.

## Idea 

When a gun is bought, the gun is programmed to work only for the owner, based on the owner's fingerprint.


## Solution

A fingerprint sensor is common place for even accessing our mobile phones, laptops, etc. The trigger is attached with a fingerprint scanner that authenticates the owner. If it is the owner pressing the trigger, then the gun works as expected. If it is not the owner, then the trigger locks for a few seconds, allowing to re-try again. If a second unauthenticated attempt is made, the gun locks down for a day or until the rightful owner presses the trigger (whichever occurs first).

*Bottom-line:* Unauthenticated pressing of trigger will not work. Only registered owner of a gun can operate the gun.
